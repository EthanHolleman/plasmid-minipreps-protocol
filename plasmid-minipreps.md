20 $\mu$g / ml.

## Other items {#other-items .unnumbered}

-   100% ethanol.

-   70% ethanol.

-   Lots of clean (autoclaved) 2 ml tubes.

-   3-5 hours of time to complete the protocol.

# Protocol {#protocol .unnumbered}

1.  Begin with a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 6 ml of overnight
    bacterial culture (if ampicillin is used as the selective medium use
    100 $\mu$/ml). If volume of culture is greater than 2 ml proceed to
    step 2, otherwise skip to step 3.

2.  Transfer culture to a 12 ml tube. Spin down bacteria at 4500 rpm at
    23 $^{\circ}$C for 10 minutes using the large bench-top centrifuge
    and the swing bucket rotor [^1].

3.  Transfer culture to a 2ml centrifuge tube and spin down bacteria at
    6,000 rpm at 23 $^{\circ}$C for 6 minutes.

4.  Remove supernantent throughly with a vacuum trap.

5.  Add 200 $\mu$l [solution I](#sec:sol-1) [^2]. Re-suspend pellets by
    vortexing vigorously. If using > 2 ml of culture (see step 2)
    transfer re-suspended bacteria to a 2 ml tube. Incubate samples at
    room temperature for 10 minutes. While you are waiting cool down the
    2 ml bench-top centrifuge to 4 $^{\circ}$C.

6.  Add 400 $\mu$l of [solution II](#sec:sol-2). Mix the samples by
    gently inverting 6 times. **Do not vortex**. Place the tubes on ice
    for exactly 5 minutes.

7.  Add 300 $\mu$l of cold [solution III](#sec:sol-3). Mix well by
    inverting several times. Incubate samples on ice for 5 minutes.

8.  Centrifuge for 5 minutes at max speed (15,000 rpm) at 4 $^{\circ}$C.

9.  Transfer the supernatant to a clean 2 ml tube. Add 1 volume (900
    $\mu$l) of isopropanol. Mix the samples by inverting several times.

10. Centrifuge samples for 15 minutes at max speed at 4 $^{\circ}$C.

11. Discard supernatent by decanting [^3] or with vacuum trap. Wash
    pellet with 500 $\mu$l of 70% ethanol. Remove ethanol wash using a
    vacuum trap.

12. Add 200 $\mu$l [10mM Tris HCL RnaseA](#sec:tris) solution to each
    sample. Vortex to disolve the pellet. Incubate samples at 37
    $^{\circ}$C for 10 minutes.

13. Add 200 $\mu$l of [10M LiCl](#sec:licl). Mix solutions by inverting
    6 times.

14. Incubate samples for $\geq$ 20 minutes at -20 $^{\circ}$C.

15. Centrifuge samples at max speed for 10 minutes at 4 $^{\circ}$C.
    Transfer the **supernatent** to a clean 2 ml tube.

16. Add 2.2 volumes of ice cold 100% ethanol. Mix samples by inverting
    several times.

17. Add 0.5 $\mu$l molecular grade glycogen (stock is 20 mg / ml) to
    each sample.

18. Centrifuge samples at max speed for 10 minutes at 4 $^{\circ}$C.
    Remove supernatent with a vacuum trap. [^4]

19. Wash the pellet up to two times with 500 $\mu$l of 70% ethanol [^5].
    Remove ethanol using a vacuum trap. Washing can sometimes dislodge
    the pellet and it can be helpful to spin samples at max speed for 2
    minutes prior to removing the wash to secure the pellet.

20. Dry the pellet for 10-15 minutes and dissolve in 40 $\mu$l [10mM
    Tris HCL pH 7.5](#sec:tris).

21. Check sample concentration using the nanodrop. If concentration is
    too high dilute sample in 40 $\mu$l steps of [10mM Tris HCL pH
    7.5](#sec:tris) until you reach a reasonable concentration (200-400
    ng/$u$l).

22. Run between 200 and 600 ng per lane of each sample on an agarose gel
    and image.

[^1]: Plastic 12 ml tubes will shatter if spun at too high a speed with
    too great a volume. If you have doubts about your tubes or have not
    used them in the centrifuge before test them by spinning a few with
    11 $\mu$l H$_{2}$O at 4200 rpm.

[^2]: I highly recommend using the serial pippetter for adding all
    solutions at this point. It will save you hours over traditional
    pipetting. If you do not know what this is or where to find it ask
    someone.

[^3]: Generally I decant the isopropanol by placing samples in the front
    row of a tube rack, facing them so the front of the tube faces away
    from the rows of the rack and using this configuration to decant all
    the samples in the rack at once. It helps to find a tube rack that
    is older and slightly deformed as these will hold onto your tubes
    better.

[^4]: Remember to use a pipette tip over the end of the vacuum tube.

[^5]: The 2/9/04 protocol recommends washing twice. I haven't noticed a
    difference between single and double wash samples but if you are
    being extra careful it doesn't hurt to wash twice.
